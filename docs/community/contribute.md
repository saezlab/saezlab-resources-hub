dedicating your time to improve our project!

## :octicons-issue-opened-24:{ .lg .middle } Bug reports and enhancement requests

Bug reports and enhancement requests are an important part of making any
software more stable. We curate them though Github issues. When opening an
issue or request, please select the appropriate category and fill out the issue
form fully to ensure others and the core development team can fully understand
the scope of the issue. If your category is not listed, you can create a blank
issue.

The issue will then show up to the saezlab-resource-hub community and be open to
comments/ideas from others.

### Categories

- [Bug Report](https://www.google.com): Report incorrect behavior in the saezlab-resource-hub library
- [Register New Component](https://www.google.com): Register a new component in the saezlab-resource-hub ecosystem, either one you have created, or one that you would like to see added
- Documentation Improvement: Report wrong or missing documentation
- Feature Request: Suggest an idea for saezlab-resource-hub
